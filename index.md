I am the president of the Hacking and Cybersecurity Club (HACC) at Iowa State University, and I specialize in malware reverse enginering. During my time at HACC, I have had the chance to go above and beyond coursework to meet with professionls and solve real-world cybersecurity problems. While engaging in these experiences, I found myself drawn to reverse engineering and malware analysis in particular. To show of the skills I have accrued, multiple writups are included below for challenges I solved and found interesting.
