### Task Description
>  The recovered data indicates the APT is using a DNS server as a part of their operation. The triage team easily got the server running but it seems to reply to every request with errors.
> 
> You decide to review past SIGINT reporting on the APT. Why might the APT be targeting the Guardian Armaments JCTV firmware developers? Reporting suggests the APT has a history of procuring information including the location and movement of military personnel.
> 
> Just then, your boss forwards you the latest status update from Barry at GA. They found code modifications which suggest additional DNS packets are being sent via the satellite modem. Those packets probably have location data encoded in them and would be sent to the APT.
> 
> This has serious implications for national security! GA is already working on a patch for the firmware, but the infected version has been deployed for months on many vehicles.
> 
> The Director of the NSA (DIRNSA) will have to brief the President on an issue this important. DIRNSA will want options for how we can mitigate the damage.
> 
> If you can figure out how the DNS server really works maybe we will have a chance of disrupting the operation.
> 
> Find an example of a domain name (ie. foo.example.com.) that the DNS server will handle and respond with NOERROR and at least 1 answer. 
> 
> Prompt:
> - Enter a domain name which results in a NOERROR response. It should end with a '.' (period)
